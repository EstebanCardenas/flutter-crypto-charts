# Real Time Flutter Crypto Charts

Mobile app made with Flutter that displays the prices of cryptocurrency assets in real time by using web-sockets. Users can search for a specific asset (or assets) by symbol. It also displays the details of an asset such as its market cap.

Each asset detail contains a graph reflecting its price across a user-selected time.
